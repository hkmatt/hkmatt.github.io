Hello and nice to meet you. I'm currently a 21-year old computer science undergraduate at the University of Maryland.
I created this blog with my intent to utilize it as an outlet; a place where I could dump my personal thoughts. 

I thought it would be nice to express my reflections of being a CS student, in addition to any topics that interests me.

Stay tuned!
