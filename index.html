            <hr><p>Welcome to my portfolio. I'm Jung Kim (call me James), a Computer Science undergraduate and a senior at University of Maryland, College Park.</p>
            <p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_RX8ykIqo8LTTJ1dmp0ODN3ckk/edit?usp=sharing"><span><i class="fa fa-file-o fa-2x"></i></span>&nbsp; Resume</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://codepen.io/jamwjam/"><span><i class="fa fa-codepen fa-2x"></i></span>&nbsp; Codepen Portfolio</a></p>
            <h3>Purpose</h3>
            <p>One of my motive for this website was to not only build to impress, but also to provide proven value in the things I do.</p> 
            <p>In my case, this portfolio reveals the validity to the words that I put into my resume - to prove the readers that I really can do things!</p>
            <h3>Implementation</h3>
            <p>This website is happily and skillfully hand-crafted by James! Web-design and development, since beginning of college I've always thought it would be cool to have an online-portfolio of my own.</p>
            <p>It's built in pure HTML &amp; CSS, and in order to create this website and publish into the web, I used several useful (and awesome) technologies.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a> - Allows users of GitHub to host their own webpage</li>

            <hr>
            <p>There are exciting technologies out there for me to learn and explore! While not always, and when I'm not tired, I like to research, tweak, and implement things that fasinates me. </p>
            <h3>Big Data</h3>
            <p>My second internship exposed me to the world of Big Data and it has been a special portion in my topic of interest ever since. <p/>
            <p>As a team contributor surrounded with developers and problem solvers, I enjoyed learning, as well as experiening my time handling very large data sets, working with intriguing tasks including: data mining and querying Hadoop, researching ad-hoc querying tools over HBase and providing documentations for others to follow.</p>    
            <h3>Website Design</h3>
            <p>I have been interested in website development and design ever since I found out building one was well within my capabilities! </p>
            <p>Another driving motivation for makeing website is that most tools I've used did not cost anything at all! These materials either have free-tier plans or were open source.</p>
            <h3>Mobile App Development</h3>
            <p>One of my main ambition of starting out mobile development was the fact that I could distribute my work everywhere through publishing them through an app store. </p> <p>My foundation and background in utilizing C#, .NET as well as Visual Studio was introduced and refined all thanks to me tinkering around with Windows Phone 7 Development which I started 2 years ago.</p>
            <p>Today, my experience in mobile development is getting more and more useful. Currently, I'm taking Human Computer Interactions in UMD, where one of the big project is a semester long sensor-focused mobile app development!</p>
